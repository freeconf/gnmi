# In this repository

* Support for [Google's gNMI](https://www.openconfig.net/docs/) server-side management protocol handlers to any Go application. gNMI is a management standard to manage a system's config and metrics.
* Works in conjunction with [FreeCONF YANG](https://github.com/freeconf/yang) and [FreeCONF RESTCONF](https://github.com/freeconf/yang) projects. If you are already using FreeCONF RESTCONF library, you can add support for Google's gNMI protocol with a couple lines of code.
* Works in conjunction with [FreeCONF lang](https://github.com/freeconf/yang) to add support for Python.
